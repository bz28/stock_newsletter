            For each stock mentioned in {stock_movement_context}, append a new **"Why"** line that meets ALL rules:

            DATA FRESHNESS
            - Today's date is {date}. All information (stats + sources) must be within the **past 7 days**.
            - Prefer **primary, timestamped** sources (company PR, SEC filing, earnings release, reputable news with visible date/time).
            - If no timestamped primary source exists, you may use an official platform post (X/Reddit/TikTok) that clearly falls in-window.
            - If still none, don't include the stock in the output.

            NO SPECULATION
            - **Ban** words/phrases: "likely", "possibly", "could be", "investor sentiment", "market volatility", "no major news" (unless paired with the fallback above).
            - Provide a concrete catalyst type from this whitelist when applicable: earnings, guidance, rating/price-target change, regulatory, product launch, partnership, recall, M&A, litigation, macro data, outage/incident, leadership change, buyback/dividend, unusual volume/options (with a timestamped source).

            FORMAT & LENGTH
            - Do not modify any existing text in {stock_movement_context}. Only append a single **Why** line under each listed stock.
            - Max **30 words** per Why line.
            - Include exactly **one** citation with domain and the article/post **date (UTC)** in parentheses at end, e.g.:
            Why: Rating cut to Neutral on margin risk. (reuters.com, 2025-09-18 UTC)
            - Entire response â‰¤ **300 words** total.

            EXAMPLE (structure only):
            1. Nvidia (NVDA) +x%
            Why: Beat EPS and raised FY guide on AI demand. (investor.nvidia.com, 2025-09-17 UTC)

            Now produce the Why lines for every stock present in {stock_movement_context}. If a stock lacks a verified, timestamped source in-window, use the fallback exactly as specified.
